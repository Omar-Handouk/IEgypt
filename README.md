When Egypt is mentioned to foreigners, they would always remember it as the land of pharaohs. There
are many myths foreigners believe about Egypt and the Egyptians; like we are living in the desert in
tents and still riding camels to work. While Egypt still maintains its historical reputation, we need to
draw attention of the public to Egypt’s investments, education, art and it’s beautiful cities. For better
exposure we need to rebrand Egypt. To maintain a consistent image that doesn’t only show it’s history
but also its future.
As computer developers, our way to do this is by building an online platform that acts as a digital society
to represent Egypt in all of its’ beautiful colors. Egypt has many talented citizens that would share their
great work. Through this platform, content providers like photographers, writers, designers ...etc. can
share their pieces of art that reflects Egypt. All of the submitted work has to follow some guidelines so
that it will help in creating an identity for Egypt. Organizations such as companies, agencies, schools...etc.
can request to use those designs in their projects.
